# Full Stack Weather CLI Application

I am excited to introduce a robust Full Stack Weather CLI application that seamlessly integrates various technologies to provide users with accurate and real-time weather updates. This application incorporates **Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, **JDBC/DAOs** for database interaction, **PostgreSQL** for secure data storage, and **RESTful APIs** for fetching weather information from openweathermap.org. The front-end is enriched with **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, powered by the **Vue.js** framework.

## Features

### User Account Creation
Users start by creating an account using Java and JDBC/DAOs for efficient data management. This ensures a personalized experience and enables the storage of user preferences securely in a PostgreSQL database.

### Location Input and RESTful APIs
Upon account creation, the application prompts users to enter their zip code, initiating a call to the openweathermap.org API using RESTful principles. This integration, facilitated by Java's RestTemplate, allows for efficient retrieval of weather data based on the user's location.

### Agile Methodologies and Scrum Framework
The development process was orchestrated using agile methodologies within a Scrum framework. This approach ensures efficient project collaboration, iterative development, and continuous feedback, resulting in a more responsive and adaptable application.

### Weather Information Display with Vue.js
The front-end, developed with Vue.js, enhances the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive experience. Users receive a clear presentation of current temperature, a detailed weather description, and visual elements such as images corresponding to the weather conditions.

### HTTP Web Services
The application leverages HTTP web services for seamless communication between the front-end and back-end, creating a cohesive and interactive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The core programming language incorporating OOP principles.
- **JDBC/DAOs:** Efficiently manage database interactions for user account and preference storage.
- **PostgreSQL:** Securely stores user information and preferences.
- **RESTful APIs:** Utilized via Java's RestTemplate to fetch real-time weather data from openweathermap.org.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS:** Front-end technologies enhancing the user interface.
- **Vue.js:** A powerful front-end framework for dynamic and responsive UI.
- **HTTP Web Services:** Facilitating communication between the application components.

This Full Stack Weather CLI application showcases the synergy of Java, OOP, JDBC/DAOs, PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Vue.js. The incorporation of agile methodologies within a Scrum framework ensures efficient collaboration and a user-centric development process.
